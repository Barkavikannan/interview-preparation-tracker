# Conditional Statements Problems


## Simple if problems

01. Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if the number is positive. If it is positive, print "The number is positive."
02. Even or Odd (using only one if) - Take an integer input from the user. If the number is even, print "The number is even."
(Note: Don't print anything if it's odd.)
03. Ask the user to input a number. If the number is divisible by 5, print "The number is divisible by 5."
04. Check for uppercase - Take a single character as input. If the character is an uppercase letter, print "The character is uppercase."
05. Eligible to vote - Write a program that asks the user for their age. If their age is 18 or older, print "You are eligible to vote."
06. Temperature Check - Ask the user to input the current temperature. If the temperature is greater than 30 degrees, print "It's hot outside."
07. Check for Vowel - Take a single character input from the user. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print "The character is a vowel."
08. Minimum Balance Warning - Write a program to check if a bank account balance is below Rs.100. If it is, print "Warning: Low balance."
09. Discount Eligibility - Ask the user for the total amount of their purchase. If the amount is greater than $500, print "You are eligible for a discount."
10. Character is Digit - Take a single character as input. If the character is a digit ('0' to '9'), print "This is a digit."


## if else problems

01. Check Positive, Negative, or Zero - Take an integer as input. If it's positive, print "Positive number." If it's negative, print "Negative number." Else, print "The number is zero."
02. Odd or Even - Take an integer as input. If it's divisible by 2, print "Even number." Else, print "Odd number."
03. Greater of Two Numbers - Take two integers as input. Print the greater number. If they are equal, print "Both numbers are equal."
04. Divisible by 3, 5 - Take an integer as input. If the number is divisible by 3, print "divisible by 3". If the number is divisible by 5, print "divisible by 5". If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "divisible by 3 and 5"
05.  Grade Assignment - Take a float score (0 to 100) as input. If the score is 90 or above, print "A." Else if it's 80 or above, print "B." Else if it's 70 or above, print "C." Else, print "F."
06. Leap Year Check - Take an integer year as input. If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400, print "Leap year." Else, print "Not a leap year."
07. Character Type - Take a single character as input. If it’s a digit ('0' to '9'), print "Digit." Else if it’s an alphabet, print "Alphabet." Else, print "Special character."
08. Quadrant of a Point - Take two float inputs representing the x and y coordinates of a point. If both are positive, print "First quadrant." Else if x is negative and y is positive, print "Second quadrant." Else if both are negative, print "Third quadrant." Else if x is positive and y is negative, print "Fourth quadrant." Else, print "Point is on the axis."
09. Number Range Check - Take an integer as input. If the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive), print "In range." Else, print "Out of range."
10. Simple Calculator - Take two floats and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input. Perform the operation and print the result. If the operator is invalid, print "Invalid operator."
